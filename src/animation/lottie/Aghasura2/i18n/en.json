  "One day Krishna was playing": "One day Krishna was playing with his friends on the banks of the Yamuna river. While they enjoyed their pastimes, Aghasura appeared there in the form of a giant snake, desiring to kill Krishna and His companions. His body was two miles long; he laid on the ground with his mouth wide open, looking like an enormous cave. The boys noticed his body in the forest and decided to explore that mysterious mountain. They entered the cave of Aghasura'â€™s mouth, and Krishna, knowing exactly what was going on, followed his friends in order to protect them. Then the gigantic demon closed his mouth and swallowed the boys and the calves.",
  "Krishna manifested His universal": "Krishna manifested His universal form and began to expand in Aghasura's stomacn. From this pressure, the vital air inside the demon's body burst through his skull, and Aphasut immediately died. The radiant soul of the demon left his body and entered the body of Krishna, whose color resembles a thundercloud."
